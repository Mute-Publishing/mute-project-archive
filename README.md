 1. Mute 2; 1989?; magazine; Slade Mute; Matchbox magazine? - 100 pages in a matchbox with one match. Used the first commercial colour laser printing and this is the reason it was matchbox sized, in that the laser printing was expensive and we could fit a lot of pages on a A3 sheet. Cover was biilboard poster with B/W laser printed name.
 1. Mute 1; 1988/89?; magazine; Slade Mute; The first Mute magazine A5 size typeset in DOS from Bruce McLean's intiative of small press works. Run by: Daniel Jackson, Simon Worthington, Helen Arthur, Steve Falcon?
